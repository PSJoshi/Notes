### Keeping anonymous on Internet
* TOR is the proven de-facto service to provide general anonymity
* Various freee/commercial VPN services also provide good privacy
* There are some peer-to-peer networks like i2p and freenet in development. You have to
dug deep to setup on your own!
* Virtual machine(s) - in one's own environment to provide security and in some way privacy; 
depends on the use
* Use of proxychains ( You can use them with Kali VM) - yes, these are not
completely anonymous; but the traffic will be tunneled through various routes
* Tails operating system is a good option as it uses Tor in the background: available as easy to setup VM and deletes all the user activity after you close the VM.
