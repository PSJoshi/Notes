### Notes
Microsoft has released preview version of Quantum Development Kit with new language - Q#. Simulations can be done locally and or on Azure cloud platform. The platform offers rich libraries and code samples.

Quantum systems are highly suspectible to decoherence. The states of quantum bits are quickly randomized by interference from the environment.Q-CTRL toolkit help teams design and deploy control for their quantum hardware to suppress these errors.

Google has released Cirq, an open source software toolkit that lets developers create algorithms without needing a background in quantum physics. Google has also released OpenFremion-Cirq for creation of 
algorithms that simulate molecules and properties of materials.
