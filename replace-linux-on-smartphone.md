## Replacing Android with Linux on smartphone
Linux can support any type of computer hardware and Android smartphone hardware is no different. It's possible to run Linux on Android smartphone if you wish.

As you know, the core of Android is Linux - i.e. kernel used in Android is based on Linux kernel. Even though, Android uses Linux Kernel, it does not come with other softwares of Linux distribution.
Android does not run typical linux applications as it uses Dalvik virtual machine to run specific applications written in Java. Android apps are specifically programmed to work on Android devices. So, Android is a bit different from Linux!

### Why linux on smartphone
Though Android is open source, it is not considered open source by many people due to the presence of proprietary softwares. These software makes Android less privacy-focused OS.

Linux offers a completely open source OS.So we can use our smartphones without any proprietary software. It will help us in keeping the data private and improving the privacy. Further, Linux is considered to be more secure than Android. So, installing a Linux on smartphone will make our devices more secure.

Linux has good support for older hardwares and it would be beneficial for smartphones. Usually, it is seen that smartphones get software updates for 3-4 years after their initial release. But, deployment of Linux enables long term software updates for smartphones, up to ten years! This will increase the life span of smartphones and will result in substantial cost savings.

Some Linux distributions have support for Android apps and this will give users a plethora of app choices (Android and Linux based apps combined). So Linux can become a nice alternative to Android.
